/**
  * This is an event sourced entity. It has a state, [[ShoppingCartState]], which
  * stores the current shopping cart items and whether it's checked out.
  *
  * Event sourced entities are interacted with by sending them commands. This
  * entity supports three commands, an [[UpdateItem]] command, which is used to
  * update the quantity of an item in the cart, a [[Checkout]] command which is
  * used to set checkout the shopping cart, and a [[Get]] command, which is a read
  * only command which returns the current shopping cart state.
  *
  * Commands get translated to events, and it's the events that get persisted by
  * the entity. Each event will have an event handler registered for it, and an
  * event handler simply applies an event to the current state. This will be done
  * when the event is first created, and it will also be done when the entity is
  * loaded from the database - each event will be replayed to recreate the state
  * of the entity.
  *
  * This entity defines two events, the [[ItemUpdated]] event, which is emitted
  * when a [[UpdateItem]] command is received, and a [[CheckedOut]] event, which
  * is emitted when a [[Checkout]] command is received.
